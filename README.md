freshfeed
=========

This is a simple Flask app which pulls in Freshdesk tickets from their API, and outputs a simple HTML page. The original
purpose of this was to display certain ticket feeds on digital signage (e.g. current tickets).

The domain and login credentials need to be set using env variables.
